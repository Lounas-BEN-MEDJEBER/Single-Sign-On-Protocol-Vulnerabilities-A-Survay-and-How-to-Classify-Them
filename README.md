# Single-Sign-On-Protocol-Vulnerabilities-A-Survay-and-How-to-Classify-Them
#Single sign on (SSO) mechanisms have become essential in modern digital environments to simplify access to services while strengthening security. This article provides an in depth audit of several major SSO protocols OpenID, SAML, CAS, and WS-Federation by analysing their historical vulnerabilities. Using data from the CVE database, CVSS scores, and EPSS percentages, the study assesses the severity and likelihood of exploitation of the vulnerabilities identified between 2007 and 2025. The resulting visual and statistical analysis highlights the security trends specific to each protocol and brings forward key periods of heightened risk. To summarise these results, a star rating has been introduced, cross referencing the levels of criticality (CVSS) and probability of exploitation (EPSS) for each protocol. This combined approach enables a clearer comparison of protocol robustness over time and supports informed decisions on protocol adoption and maintenance in real-world environments.
